I am a Lecturer in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the Islamic University of Technology (IUT). I am also a part of the NDAG-Lab.
My research interests lie in the fields of Multimodal Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Robustness Analysis.

Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from IUT. I had a wonderful time as an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. Jingwen Leng at the NDAG-Lab.
