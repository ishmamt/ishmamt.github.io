I am a Lecturer in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the <a href="https://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/">Islamic University of Technology</a>. I am also a part of the NDAG-Lab.

My research interests lie in the fields of Multimodal Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Robustness Analysis.

Previously, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from IUT. I had a wonderful time as an undergraduate researcher advised by <a href="https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu/profile/azam/education">Dr. Md. Azam Hossain</a> at the NDAG-Lab.
